# Kafka Topics Commands

Remember that topics are managed by zoo-keeper, the kafka brokers uses zookeeper for all topic management.

### List Topics

The below commands list all the topics.

```bash
kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
```

### Create new topic

```bash
    kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic greetings --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3 
```

### Describe the topics

```bash
kafka-topics --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic greetings
```




### Delete the topics**

```bash
kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:2181 --delete --topic greetings
```

Remember topics are not deleted immediately, they shall be *marked for deletion* if no consumer or producer exists for the same topic. Re-creating same topics again immediately would cause *topic already exists* error.

Zookeeper shell has a command to revert the topic deletion, but it cannot be useful if the topic already deleted.

```
rmr /admin/delete_topics/greetings 
```



    kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic orders2

    kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic orders2
