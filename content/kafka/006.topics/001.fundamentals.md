# Kafka Topics

Kafka Topics are the foundation for how multiple systems connect and talk to each other.
When you deploy multiple systems like billing, inventory, shipping, click streaming, orders, promotions systems,
topics connect them.

When an order is placed, the order system places the newly created order information into 'orders' topics, 
and then 'orders' topic is subscribed by multiple systems like shipping, inventory, promotions.

A publisher publish the information into a topic, and a topic can have zero or many subscribers called consumer groups.

# Zoo Keeper

The topics are created inside Zookeeper and topics are managed by Zookeeper.
